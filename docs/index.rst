abx-release-tools
=================

Shared release tooling for ABX (AI Builder Experience) integrations:
``mongodb/strands-mongodb``,
``mongodb-developer/ms-agent-framework-mongodb``,
``mongodb-developer/claude-agent-sdk-mongodb-session-store``, and new
integrations that join that list.

The tooling covers the four secure-release steps every ABX release
needs, plus the setup action that precedes them:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   Setup <setup>
   Dependency scanning with SilkBomb <scanning>
   Artifact signing with Garasign <signing>
   Artifact tracing: Papertrail or the authorized-publication report <tracing>
   Trusted publishing to PyPI <publishing>

Which CI system can run which step
----------------------------------

A cell holding ``✅`` means the step is the same work either way. A cell
naming a command or a mechanism means the two systems do different
things, not two implementations of the same thing.

   * - Step
     - Evergreen
     - GitHub Actions
     - Notes
   * - Dependency scanning
     - ``silkbomb upload``
     - ``silkbomb update``, then ``augment``
     - Two halves of scanning, not one job twice. Evergreen pushes the
       dependency list to Kondukto and produces no release artifact.
       GitHub Actions produces ``cyclonedx.sbom.json``, the SBOM that
       ships with the release. Only the second needs
       ``KONDUKTO_TOKEN``; ``upload`` is satisfied by the silkbomb IAM
       role. Each template does one half because that is how it was
       written, not because the other system cannot.
   * - Artifact signing
     - ✅
     - ✅
     - Same Garasign container, same GPG key, same output.
   * - Artifact tracing
     - ``papertrail.trace``
     - authorized-publication report
     - Both satisfy the requirement. Neither produces what the other
       does: Evergreen records one trace per downloadable file in
       Papertrail, GitHub Actions writes a report to the release S3
       bucket.
   * - Publishing to PyPI
     -
     - ✅
     - Trusted publishing works by PyPI checking a GitHub OIDC token,
       and Evergreen cannot present one. The only way to publish from
       Evergreen is a stored PyPI API token, which is what trusted
       publishing exists to remove.

So this is not a choice between two platforms. Every ABX repo
publishes from GitHub Actions, because no other system can. A repo
that also has an Evergreen project can run the three earlier steps
there, which is what ``evergreen/`` is for. One repo using both
systems is the normal case, not a transition state.

The input SBOM is the one piece of the pipeline that is shared
outright: both systems build it with the same script. See
:doc:`scanning`.

Provenance and the verification trail live in the repo README. Pin
every action to a commit SHA in real workflows.
